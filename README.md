# GeoClean-SJ
An AI-powered web application that uses a YOLO-based deep learning model to detect and classify urban pollution into six categories: birds, roadkill, trash, graffiti, potholes, and weeds. Users can upload images, and receive real-time predictions to support environmental monitoring and cleanup efforts. By integrating with city surveillance infrastructure — such as cameras and patrol vehicles — the system enables automatic detection and reporting of environmental issues. This proactive approach helps the city respond faster, allocate resources more efficiently, maintain cleaner public spaces, and ultimately reduce long-term maintenance costs while improving community health and urban appeal.
